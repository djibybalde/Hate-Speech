# Hate-Speech
### Hate speech dataset from a white supremacist forum

**`hate`** file contains only the sentences that are considered as `hate speech`. 
**`nohate`** file contains only the sentences that are not considered as `hate speech`.
Both `hate` and `noHate` sentences can be found in the **`hate_speech`** file.

**Note** that in each file, one line is equivalent to one sentence.

The initiale dataset was downloaded from the [Aitor García Pablos](https://github.com/aitor-garcia-p) GitHube website.

"These files contain text extracted from Stormfront, a white supremacist forum. A random set of forums posts have been sampled from several subforums and split into sentences. Those sentences have been manually labelled as containing hate speech or not, according to certain annotation guidelines". [Aitor García Pablos](https://github.com/aitor-garcia-p)
